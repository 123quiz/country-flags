country-flags
=============

This repository contains renders of all the worlds flags in PNG format.

The source files were taken from Wikipedia and are not under copyright
protection since flags are effectively in public domain (there may be other
restrictions on how the flag can be used though).

The flags are named by their 2-letter ISO country code.

Also included is a JSON file that maps the ISO country code to the name of the
country.
